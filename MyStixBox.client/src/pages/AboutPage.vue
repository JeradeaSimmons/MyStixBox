        <p>My name is JD Simmons,
      I have found Cigar smoking to be my meditation. But it has also become a way
      to meet some pretty bad ass people. Smoking in a lounge you can meet strangers and become
      great friends. You definitely will learn something new in these conversations as long as 
      you are present and engaged. One thing I have learned is a lot of people want to keep track 
      of the cigars they try. And also are looking for recommendations on new ones to try. I haven't came across a great app for that. If it is out there I just haven't found it. But I have recently graduated from a Software Development BootCamp and now have the ability to put one together. So here it is! If there is any suggestions or things you think I should add, reach out and let me know. I want this to be user friendly and a way to track what you have smoked, find new sticks, and connect with some of your fellow Cigar Smokers.
